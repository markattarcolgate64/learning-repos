## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Mathematical Foundations
- Linear algebra essentials (vectors, matrices, projections)
- Calculus for optimization (gradients, Hessians)
- Probability and statistics fundamentals
- The geometry of least squares

### Phase 2: Derivations & Proofs
- Derive the normal equations from scratch
- Prove properties of OLS estimators
- Understand the Gauss-Markov theorem
- Connect maximum likelihood to least squares

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Build linear regression from scratch (no sklearn!)
- Implement gradient descent variants
- Code regularization techniques
- Create diagnostic tools

### Phase 4: Problem Solving
- Analytical problems (pen and paper)
- Numerical exercises
- Real-world case studies
- Interview-style questions

### Phase 5: Advanced Topics
- Regularization theory (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)
- Bayesian linear regression
- Robust regression
- Connections to neural networks

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Don't skip the math** - The derivations build intuition that coding alone won't give you
2. **Try before you peek** - Solutions are provided, but struggle first
3. **Write out proofs by hand** - Physical writing helps retention
4. **Implement from scratch** - Then compare to established libraries
5. **Teach it back** - Explain concepts to a rubber duck (or friend)

## Prerequisites

- Basic calculus (derivatives, partial derivatives)
- Basic linear algebra (matrix multiplication, transpose)
- Basic probability (mean, variance, distributions)
- Python with NumPy

## Difficulty Ratings

- ⭐ Foundational - Should be comfortable after Phase 1
- ⭐⭐ Intermediate - Requires solid understanding
- ⭐⭐⭐ Challenging - May require multiple attempts
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Advanced - Research-level depth
